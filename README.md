I initially started with MindEase using Bolt.new’s conversational UI before the submission period, but the prompt outcomes didn’t align with user needs. I pivoted to building Pocket Crisis Plan focusing on journaling, emotion tracking, and an AI chat assistant during submission period. This shift not only improved the product’s reliability, it truly aligned with my mission to support mental wellness. It taught me flexibility, resilience, and how to learn fast during the hackathon.

# Pocket Crisis Plan

## What It Does
Pocket Crisis Plan is a mental health support app that helps users build their own emotional first-aid kit — something they can turn to in moments of distress.

## Why I Built It
I've always believed that when someone is going through a mental or emotional crisis, what they need most isn't a lecture or a hotline. They need a moment of calm, clarity, and something that reminds them why they want to hold on.

I built Pocket Crisis Plan because I’ve seen people struggle silently, including myself at times. It's hard to reach out for help in those moments. This app is designed to be a personal safety net—something gentle, quiet, and always there.

Whether you're feeling anxious, alone, or overwhelmed, it offers structured support: calming techniques, reminders of what matters, your trusted contacts, and even a space to reflect.

I wanted this to feel like carrying a mental health first-aid kit in your pocket—because everyone deserves support, even when they don't know how to ask for it.
