# Pocket Crisis Plan

## What It Does
Pocket Crisis Plan is a mental health support app that helps users build their own emotional first-aid kit â€” something they can turn to in moments of distress.

## Why I Built It
In hard moments, we often forget what could help us. This app acts as a gentle, pre-prepared lifeline to self-compassion, connection, and emotional grounding.

## Features
- **Crisis Plan Setup**: Add calming tools, trusted contacts, reasons to stay, and comforting content.
- **Emotion-Tagged Journaling**: Write your thoughts, tag them with how you feel, and reflect later.
- **Emotion Heatmap**: View your emotional trends over the past 7 days.
- **MindEase Chat**: An empathetic AI assistant that offers support and emotional validation like a caring friend.
- **Smart Search**: Search journal entries by keywords or emotion filters like `emotion:happy`.

## Built With
- React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Context API + LocalStorage
- (Optional) OpenAI API for MindEase responses
